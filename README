SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

     pminfo
     pmversion

     pmdoc

FAQ
  What is the purpose of this distribution? Haven't other utilities existed?
    For example, mpath in Module::Path distribution, mversion in
    Module::Version distribution, etc.

    True. The main point of these utilities is shell tab completion, to save
    typing.

  In shell completion, why do you use / (slash) instead of :: (double colon) as it should be?
    If you type module name which doesn't contain any ::, / will be used as
    namespace separator. Otherwise if you already type ::, it will use ::.

    Colon is problematic because by default it is a word breaking character
    in bash. This means, in this command:

     % pmpath Text:<tab>

    bash is completing a new word (empty string), and in this:

     % pmpath Text::ANSITabl<tab>

    bash is completing "ANSITabl" instead of what we want "Text::ANSITabl".

    The solution is to use quotes, e.g.

     % pmpath "Text:<tab>
     % pmpath 'Text:<tab>

    or, use /.
